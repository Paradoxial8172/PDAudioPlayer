Hello :)

Thank you for downloading PD (PD stands for Paradise) Audio Player version 1.0!

This program was written in Python, you can actually look at the 
sourcecode, itll be inside the folder called "player". 
You will need to install Python and all the modules used
in this program in order to run it in a code compiler. 
(I recommend you use Visual Studios Code, Pycharm, or Atom)
To start the program, go into the \player folder and open the file 
named "ParadiseAudioPlayer.exe". This program may take a couple seconds
to run.

Enjoy! <3
